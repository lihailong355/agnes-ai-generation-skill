description: Call Agnes AI / Sapiens AI generation APIs for text, image, and video. Use when the user asks to use Agnes models, Agnes Image, Agnes Video, Agnes 2.0 Flash, apihub.agnes-ai.com, or to generate text, images, edit images, create videos, animate images, create keyframe videos, or test Agnes API calls.

# Agnes AI Generation

Use this skill to call Agnes text, image, and video generation APIs through `https://apihub.agnes-ai.com`.

## Quick Start

1. Read `references/api.md` when endpoint details, parameters, or response fields are needed.
2. Use `scripts/agnes_api.py` for real API calls instead of rewriting curl by hand.
3. Require an API key in `AGNES_API_KEY`, `AGNES_API_TOKEN`, or `APIHUB_AGNES_API_KEY`. Never print the key.
4. For light live verification, run `smoke-test`; it avoids video creation by default. Add `--include-image-edit` for image-to-image, and add `--video-case <case>` explicitly for video modes. Treat the skill as fully tested only when basic text, text streaming, text tool calling, text-to-image, image-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, multi-image video, keyframe video, and video retrieval return successful responses.

## Commands

Text generation:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py text --prompt "Write a concise product tagline for an AI assistant."
```

Streaming text:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py text --prompt "Write a short product intro." --stream
```

Streaming output is normalized and includes aggregated `content`, `events`, `done`, and a short `raw_prefix`.

Image generation:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py image --prompt "A luminous floating city above a misty canyon at sunrise, cinematic realism" --size 1024x768
```

Image-to-image:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py image --prompt "Turn the scene into a rainy cyberpunk night while preserving composition" --image https://example.com/input.png --size 1024x768
```

Text-to-video with polling:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py video --prompt "A cinematic shot of a cat walking on the beach at sunset" --poll
```

Image-to-video:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py video --prompt "Animate subtle camera movement and natural lighting" --image https://example.com/image.png --poll
```

Keyframe / multi-image video:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py video --prompt "Create a smooth cinematic transition between the two keyframes" --image https://example.com/a.png --image https://example.com/b.png --mode keyframes --poll
```

Retrieve a video task:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py video-get task_123456
```

Light live smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py smoke-test
```

Image edit smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py smoke-test --include-image-edit
```

Single video smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py smoke-test --video-case text-to-video
```

### Batch Video Pipeline (Story → Video)

Generate a complete video from a story with automatic storyboard generation, character references, parallel video generation, and seamless stitching:

```bash
# Auto-generate storyboard and full video in one command
python scripts/agnes_api.py video-batch \
  --story "农夫与蛇" \
  --num-segments 6 \
  --duration 10 \
  --output farmer-snake.mp4

# Or use a pre-generated storyboard
python scripts/agnes_api.py video-batch \
  --storyboard storyboard.json \
  --output my-video.mp4

# Generate just the storyboard
python scripts/agnes_api.py video-storyboard \
  --story "A knight battles a dragon" \
  --num-segments 4
```

### Download Videos from URLs

```bash
python scripts/agnes_api.py video-download \
  --urls "url1.mp4,url2.mp4,url3.mp4" \
  --output-dir ./my-videos
```

## Workflow

- Prefer `agnes-2.0-flash` for text chat/completions.
- Prefer `agnes-image-2.1-flash` for text-to-image, image-to-image, and high-information-density image generation. High-density generation is prompt-driven; include subject hierarchy, environment, secondary details, lighting, composition, and quality requirements.
- Prefer `agnes-video-v2.0` for text-to-video, image-to-video, multi-image video, keyframe animation, prompt-based motion and scene control, cinematic output, asynchronous task creation, polling-based result retrieval, and seed-based reproducibility.
- For image and video generation, convert any non-English user prompt to a fluent English generation prompt before calling the image/video API. English prompts are more stable for Agnes video generation. Preserve concrete visual details, style, lighting, composition, motion, camera instructions, and constraints during translation.
- For videos, remember the API is asynchronous: create a task first, then poll or retrieve by task id.
- The script validates image sizes, video frame counts, frame rates, and dimensions before sending requests. `num_frames` must be `8n + 1` and `<= 441`; `81` or `121` are good short values.
- The video command defaults to `num_frames=121` and `frame_rate=24` for more stable generation. Video smoke tests default to `num_frames=81` and `frame_rate=24`.
- Warn the user before costly or long-running live video generation unless they explicitly asked to test or generate video.
- Test video capabilities one at a time with `smoke-test --video-case <case>` to avoid creating many tasks at once. Supported cases are `text-to-video`, `image-to-video`, `multi-image`, and `keyframes`.
- **Batch workflow**: For long stories, use `video-batch` to automate the full pipeline. It generates a storyboard, character reference images, all video segments in parallel, downloads them, and stitches into a seamless final video with xfade crossfade transitions.
- **Storyboard quality**: The `video-storyboard` command produces professional storyboards with unique camera angles, distinct actions per segment, and character state tracking to avoid repeated shots.

## Current Validation Notes

- Confirmed locally: skill metadata validation and Python syntax.
- Confirmed by live API: basic text, streaming text, tool-calling request shape, text-to-image, image-to-image, high-information-density text-to-image, Chinese prompt translation for image/video, completed text-to-video URL retrieval, and completed image-to-video URL retrieval.
- Caveat: Agnes may accept tool-calling request parameters without consistently returning `tool_calls`; use `smoke-test --strict-tools` when strict tool-call validation is required.
- Supported by the script and smoke-test selector, but not re-run end-to-end in the latest pass: multi-image video and keyframe animation.
- Not yet confirmed end-to-end: completed URL retrieval for every multi-image video and keyframe animation task. A previous text-to-video task returned a provider-side `division by zero` error, so keep video retries visible and report provider errors clearly.

## Output Handling

- Return or save generated URLs from the JSON response.
- For image responses, expect URL-style results when `extra_body.response_format` is `url`.
- For video responses, extract URLs from `video_url`, `url`, or `remixed_from_video_id` when `status` is `completed`.
- If a request fails, report HTTP status and provider error body without exposing the API key.
